Bilebio
#######

Bilebio is a highscore game where you attempt to escape various rooms of
ravenously growing plants. The player passes the stage when he/she gets to
the far side of the room without being entanged. The player becomes entangled
when a plant grows directly onto him. The player gets bonus points for
collecting nectar, which shows up at random intervals at random locations.

At the end of each stage the player gets a few choices for upgrades to help
get past the ever faster spreading plants.

There are three kinds of plants which have different rules for growth:

Roots (%).
    Roots are rare and probably spred the quickest even though they can only
    grow once before becoming "stale"*. The root grows like so:
        ~
       ~*~
      ~*%*~
       ~*~
        ~
    After the root becomes stale it can still grow by tossing another root
    anywhere on the map the player (or plant) isn't located.

Flowers (*).
    Flowers can grow up to 4 times. The can grow another flower in a L pattern.
       ~ ~
      ~   ~
        *
      ~   ~
       ~ ~
Vines (~).
    Vines can grow up to 2 times. They grow either another vine (75%), or a
    flower (25%) right next to them in the eight cardinal directions.

* Stale means the plant has used up it's main method of growing.
