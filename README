========
Overview
========

Bilebio is a highscore game where you attempt to escape various rooms of
ravenously growing plants. The player passes the stage when he/she gets to
the far side of the room without being entanged. The player becomes entangled
when a plant grows directly onto him. The player gets bonus points and energy
for collecting nectar, which shows up at random intervals at random locations.
You can use energy to learn abilities (up to three) that may help you escape.

There are three kinds of plants which have different rules for growth:

Roots (%).
    Roots are the largest threat in BileBio. They can grow in giant burts or
    create more roots near the player. The burst pattern looks like:
        ~
       ~*~
      ~*%*~
       ~*~
        ~
    The root, after becoming active, has a 10% to spawn another root somewhere
    near the player, and a 90% to burst. Roots grow the slowest.

Flowers (*).
    Flowers can grow up to 2 times. The can grow another flower (75%) or a vine
    (25%). They grow in a chess knight pattern, and grow slightly slower than
    Vines.

Vines (~).
    Vines can grow up to 2 times. They can only grow other vines right next to
    themselves. Vines grow slightly faster than Flowers.

Nectar ($)
    Collect this to gain score and energy. It has a half-life of about 40 turns
    so get there quick!
